Rock Paper Scissors Project for Odin Project Lessons
This is my first javascript project that i'll be attempting.

## Ideas Before Beginning

This project seems to be designed in order to test my abilities to problem 
solve with the information I've learned so far in the Javascript lessons. 
Syntax seems like it could give me the most trouble. 

Prompts are used to guide the problem solving but before reading through them 
an if/else statement or switch statement might be the easiest way to handle how
the winner is chosen.

## Ideas after Completing

Project was difficult to complete entirely using the guidelines given. I would have chosen a different approach to solve the rock paper scissors problem but I enjoyed the challenge and learned more about Javascript while having to determine how to find the solution that complied with the guidelines given.
